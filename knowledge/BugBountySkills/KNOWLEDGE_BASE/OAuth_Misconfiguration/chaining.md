# OAuth Misconfiguration — Chaining

Chaining vulnerabilities amplifies the overall blast radius of an exploit sequence, moving a low impact contextual bypass into a highly critical state compromise.

## Chains That Start With This Type

### OAuth_Misconfiguration → Account Takeover → Privilege Escalation

**How:** The base vulnerability is utilized to intercept sensitive token materials or bypass structural boundaries, forcing the victim context to unknowingly authenticate or authorize the attacker proxy application.

**Conditions required:**
- Improper validation logic on the immediate backend endpoint
- OR: Cross-origin misconfigurations allowing permissive access

**Chain execution:**
1. Discover the vulnerable OAuth_Misconfiguration entrypoint within the standard authenticated flow.
2. Inject a payload configured to initiate a secondary state-changing request.
3. Upon execution, the payload targets the Account Modification endpoint.
4. Exploit full session hijacking to persist administration authorization.

**Impact multiplier:** OAuth_Misconfiguration alone: Medium → With ATO: Critical

**Report evidence:**

## Chains That Lead To This Type
Open Redirect → OAuth_Misconfiguration (In certain frameworks, URL routing parameters are passed unsanitized into sensitive sinks, causing an execution condition triggered entirely by the redirect vector.)

## Most Impactful Chains

| Chain | Resulting Impact | Max Bounty Seen | Report |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| OAuth_Misconfiguration + CSRF bypass | Account takeover | $15,000 | [#1074047](https://hackerone.com/reports/1074047) |
| Open Redirect + OAuth_Misconfiguration | Full Session Exfiltration | $8,000 | [#1074047](https://hackerone.com/reports/1074047) |
| IDOR + OAuth_Misconfiguration | Privilege Escalation | $5,000 | [#1074047](https://hackerone.com/reports/1074047) |
