# RCE — Bypasses

 This bypass strategy involves manipulating standard HTTP transport mechanics to evade signature detection.

## WAF Bypasses

### Generic WAF Bypasses Approach

**Defense being bypassed:** Default Application WAF Bypasses
**Bypass technique:**
```text
%252e%252e%252f 
```
**Why it works:** Double encoding tricks the front-end firewall processor which only unescapes once before handing off to the backend processor which unescapes again, creating structural breaks.
**Confirmed in:** [Report #1001255](https://hackerone.com/reports/1001255) — Program Vendor — $1000
**Frequency:** Seen in 5 reports in this corpus
**Affected versions:** General framework routing versions

> [!NOTE]
> Vendors routinely patch these generic encoding flaws, verify backend unescape logic dynamically.

## Input Validation Bypasses

### Generic Input Validation Bypasses Approach
